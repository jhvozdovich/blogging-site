      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <h4>Personal</h4>
      <p>Hi there! I'm Matt from Washington and I'm an avid Counterstrike player.</p>
      <p>I've been playing off and on for a few years.</p>
      <p>While it can be hard to find the time to play these days, I'm still enjoying covering news and fun experiences here on the blog.</p>
      <h4>Play Style</h4>
      <p>Teamwork and communication is critical. I prefer to set up servers with friends to collaborate for more strategic matches.</p>
